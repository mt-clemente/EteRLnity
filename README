You can configure the training in the Network/param.py file

To train instances use $ make a for instance A, $make b for B and so on.

If you want to test the models you train, put them in the models/inference folder as follows (for instance A):


models/
    Inference/
        A/
            embeds/
                embed_state.pt
                embed_tiles.pt
            heads/
                actor_head.pt
                critic_head.pt
            transformers/
                actor_dt.pt
                critic_dt.pt
